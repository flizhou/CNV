# CNV

The project aimed to identify genomic deletions in P. falciparum crosses genome data, as a preliminary to develop an efficient method to identify copy number variants. 

Genome data from different progenies were first cleaned and then processed with a statistical-based algorithm (method1 or method2) to identify deletions.

Considering that the data processed have not been published, only data format example was uploaded.
